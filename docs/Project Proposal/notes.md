## AMSTELHAEGE
A new residential area will be developed in the Duivendrechtse polder

There is an area of **200x170** meters for this new neighbourhood

A plan must be made and the district is looking at multiple variants: **40, 70 and 100 houses**.

**Note:** During the lecture I said to optimize the revenue, but you can optimize the area as well. Do whatever you like in your research question.

**Create a ground plan for each of three variants for the new neighbourhood “Amstelhaege”**

### Three different types of houses:
  - Family Homes, Bungalows and Mansions
  - You can flip the houses
  - Each house needs to have some free space around it called clearance

### Surface Water
  - **20%** of the total area
  - **At most 4 bodies** of water with side ratios of **1:4**

Because Amstelhaege needs to be a family friendly neighborhood the district wants to include playgrounds and **make sure these are easily accessible for every house in the region**.

- A playground is **30x20** meters and should be placed in such a way that each house is **no more than 50 meters** away
- A playground does **not count as clearance**
- A playground costs **€ 500 000,-**
- You may place **as many as you want**

### 50% Family Homes: 8x8m
€ 285.000,- (+3% pm)
2m clearance

### 30% Bungalows :10x7.5m
€ 399.000,- (+4% pm)
3m clearance

### 20% Mansions:11x10.5m
€ 610.000,- (+6% pm)
6m clearance

### Advanced Assignment
Find the optimal number of houses (with and without playgrounds) if no restrictions hold for the numbers per type. That is, any type can be used or not.
