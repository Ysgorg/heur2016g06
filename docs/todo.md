# TODO 

 - clean up repo a bit
 - implement a function that runs all experiments and visualizes results # so we can paste into report
 - make a diagram of the above function # is documentation of our experimental setup
 - generate dependency diagram of our code # maybe it helps describe our code
 - compute optimal pg_placement # brute-forcable
 - improve `tight` : water placement, pg placement 

 - pythonize before it's too late. codebase is getting larger and less maintainable
