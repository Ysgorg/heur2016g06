# Development log

## 11.1.17

 - downloaded code from blackboard
 - ran intellij's code analysis, removing redundant paranthesis and semicolons
 - inited __main__.py, where our future code will init
 - inited README.md
 - copied research proposal doc into docs/proposal.rmd
 - inited docs/todo.md

## 12.1.17

 - debugged given code
 - made brute force algo which produces correct but not very good solutions, without playground
 - made brute force algo into evolver
 - made config log interface, enabling saving and loading of plans on disk
 - modularising DistrictPlanner, using in Evolver as base of layout

## 13.1.17

 - debugging and prettifying evolver
 - cleaning out print statements from groundplan
 - take command line input to determine which algo to run and enable file loading

 ## 14.1.17

 - Notice 1:4 water body dimension constraint
 - Compute water body dimensions given num_waterbodies, assuming equal dimensions for all water bodies and floats are valid coordinates
 - Compute good water body dimensions assuming coordinates must be int // probably not the case, since some Placeable have .5 dimensions
 - Visualize and compute how much area is available for placing residences on, based on location of water and playgrounds

##  16.1.17

 - ???? see commit comments TODO remember to keep this log updated
